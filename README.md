# constrained-code-switch-MT

This repository contains Marian NMT beam search code that supports decoding constrained to source sentence(s). During decoding, the output vocabulary is restricted to the tokens that appear in the input source(s).

This was intended for Edinburgh's submission to code-switched translation shared task (MixMT) at WMT 2022. Generic stuff like the model, vocab, and outputs were originally developed by Faheem Kirefu.
